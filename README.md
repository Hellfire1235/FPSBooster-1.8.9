FPSBooster-1.8.9 is a mod designed to optimize certain aspects of a modded Minecraft experience using simple, targeted optimizations. 
FPSBooster focuses on the following aspects of modded Minecraft in particular: 
Memory usage (in Minecraft 1.8+). This is the original reason FPSBooster was made for, and the most important reason for it being adopted in modpacks today. Observations show that, on particularly heavy modpacks, Java heap usage (as measured on the main menu, after the game has finished loading, with VisualVM) can fall by as much as 50%! TPS usage, particularly on larger servers - ghost chunk-loading and network improvements will not help the single-player experience much, but can be incredibly beneficial when trying to scale up a multiplayer world.
